# VBA Challenege

## Refactoring VBA Code and Checking Performance

## Purpose

### The purpose of this project was to refactor an original VBA code and make it more efficient. We wanted to collect stock inforamtion from the data provided in the years 2017 and 2018.This refactoring included taking less steps to perform the same analysis as well as simplify it to make it easier for future users. 

## Results

### The analysis includes two charts of information showing the TotalDailyVolume given in a monetary value and Return given as a percentage for the 12 different stock tickers included in our data. The stocks are presented as Tickers which are shorter acronyms for the original names. The original information that provided the stock information included the ticker, the date the stock was issued,opening price, closing price, adjusted closing as well as the highest and lowest price, the total daily volume and the return on each stock.

## Summary 
### The advantages to refactoring code is that it allows you to have a template to work with without having to start all over. It also allows you to alter the code and if something doesnt work you will always have start point to go back to. Some disadvatages to refactoring are that you can easily get lost in the way the code can be simplified. Sometimes making too big of a change can alter your entire code and make it so you have to go all the way through the code to make it work again.

### The advantages to refactoring VBA script is that it allows for less repetition and you can combine codes together.Also when refactoring the original code small changes can help to make the script more simplified such as creating an array that can be used multiple times and in different ways. The disavantages to refactoring VBA script is that sometimes things get lost in translation and minor differences in thing such as a variable used can cause a code to not function appropriately. Another disadvantage is that it can be very time consuming if the script is already simplified to the best of your knowledge and you start adding foreign concepts.
